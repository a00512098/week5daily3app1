# Week 5 Daily 3 App 1

* Have the user enter the following information:
    * ProductName
    * ProductIDNumber
    * ProductInventoryCount
    * ProductDescription
* Have a button that will send the above info to App2 using a broadcast reciever
* Restrict broadcast so only the two apps can use that broadcast

This is how the app looks: ![alt text][img1]
