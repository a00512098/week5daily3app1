# Week 5 Daily 3 App 1

* Have the user enter the following information:
    * ProductName
    * ProductIDNumber
    * ProductInventoryCount
    * ProductDescription
* Have a button that will send the above info to App2 using a broadcast reciever
* Restrict broadcast so only the two apps can use that broadcast

This app lets the user add information about a product and then it sends that information through a broadcast for a different app to receive it and add it to a database.
This is how the app looks: ![alt text] [img1]
